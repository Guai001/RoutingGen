  xcot_system: "You are an expert Python programmer responsible for providing a structured problem-solving approach to implementing Python functions.  Your task is to analyze the specified functional requirements and produce a structured solution breakdown."
  
  xcot_examples:
    - user: |
          Write a function to sum the length of the names of a given list of names after removing the names that start with a lowercase letter.
          
      assistant: |
          1.Loop the input list.
          2.If the name not start with lowercase letter, add the length of the name to result.
          3.Return the result.
    
    - user: |
          Write a function to increment the numeric values in the given strings by k.
          
      assistant: |
          1.Loop the input list.
          2.If a string is a number, increment it.
          3.Return modified list.
          
    - user: |
          Write a python function to find sum of all prime divisors of a given number.
          
      assistant: |
          1.Create a inner function to check if a number is prime.
          2.Loop all number less than the input that is prime.
          3.Check if the input is divisible by that.
          4.Return the result.
