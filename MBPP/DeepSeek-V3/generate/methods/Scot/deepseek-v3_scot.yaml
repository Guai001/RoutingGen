          " Write a python function to reverse the given string. "
          Your code should pass these tests:\n\n["assert reverse_string('hello') == 'olleh'", "assert reverse_string('') == ''", "assert reverse_string('1234@abc') == 'cba@4321'", "assert reverse_string('a') == 'a'"]\n
          Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with a input-output structure. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.
