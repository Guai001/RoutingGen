          def encrypt(s):
            \"\"\"
            Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.
            
            For example:
            encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
            encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
            encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
            encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
            \"\"\"

          1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.
          2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.
          3. Return result.

          def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
            \"\"\"
            Create a function that returns True if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not a part of a word, and False otherwise. Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

            Examples:
            check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") → False
            check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") → True
            check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") → False
            check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") → False  
            \"\"\"
          
      assistant: |
          1. If the string is empty, return False.
          2. If the string does not end with a alphabetical character, return False.
          3. Split the given string into a list of words.
          4. Check if the length of the last word is equal to 1.
          
    - user: |
          def file_name_check(file_name):
            \"\"\"
            Create a function which takes a string representing a file’s name, and returns ’Yes’ if the the file’s name is valid, and returns ’No’ otherwise.
            A file’s name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions are met:
            - There should not be more than three digits (’0’-’9’) in the file’s name.
            - The file’s name contains exactly one dot ’.’ The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet (’a’-’z’ and ’A’-’Z’).
            - The substring after the dot should be one of these: [’txt’, ’exe’, ’dll’]

            Examples:
            file_name_check("example.txt") => ’Yes’
            file_name_check("1example.dll") => ’No’ (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)  
            \"\"\"
          
      assistant: |
          1. Check if the file name is valid according to the conditions.
          2. Return "Yes" if valid, otherwise return "NO".
