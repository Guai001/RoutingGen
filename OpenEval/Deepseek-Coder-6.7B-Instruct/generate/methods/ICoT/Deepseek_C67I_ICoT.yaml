          Please analyze the requirement and provide a structured solving process with the following format:  
              1: Specification  
                - Define the input and output format concisely.   
              2: Idea: Summarize the core logic and optimal algorithm with time complexity.

          1: Specification:
            - Input: A string.
            - Output: The reversed version of the input string.
          2: Idea:
            -	Use slicing `[::-1]` to efficiently reverse the string in **O(n) time complexity**.

            - Iterate over the list, square each element, and sum the results.
            - This approach has **O(n)** time complexity, where **n** is the length of the list.
