    You will see a Python coding task(including the task description and function implementatio).
    Please classify its task complexity into one of three categories:
    - Easy
    - Medium
    - Hard

    Consider data structures, algorithmic complexity, edge cases, implementation steps, recursion, etc.

    Output in the following format:
    Medium: because it requires recursive logic and careful base case handling.

    The function task is as follows:
    {prompt_text}
