          Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with a input-output structure. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.

          Output: reversed_str: the reversed version of str  
          1: Initialize reversed_str as an empty string.  
          2: for each character ch in str from the last to the first:
